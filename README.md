# Traffic-Light-Control-System---A-Model-Based-Software-Design-Approach
In this project, a Traffic Light Control System (TLCS) using Model-Based Software Design approch. The project implemented according to Agile Software Development Process, which starts with project planning and lists system requirement in a Requirement Specification Sheet. Then the TLCS system architecture was developed using a software design approach. Later, utilizing Simulink/State Flow Graphs, a Software Design Block diagram was created and put into use. Following that, a test harness was made, and several test cases were checked to see if the project's criteria were being satisfied.
